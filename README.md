## Basic data manipulation

This repository aims to collect basic methods to help people  with little programming background, to perform simple tasks, such as transposing a large matrix.

In order to do that, users are advised to read a starting guide to github [here](https://computational-chemical-biology.github.io/ccbl_tutorials/git/) and [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

After that, users should `Fork` this repository, by clicking the `Fork` bottom on the top right hand corner of this repository. This will create a copy to the users account, where they can add code to their copies, and after that communicate the copies to the `master`repository with a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
